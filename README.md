# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

- For this project, I used RStudio to analyze car production data for AutosRUs'. The company is trying to build a MechaCar prototype, but they are having problems with production, which are blocking the manufacturing team's progress. The goal of my analysis is to figure out where the problems are coming from and provide solutions to fix them.
